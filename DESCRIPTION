Package: cutoffbasedonMCC
Type: Package
Title: This package takes a data, takes a n, takes the coefficient of the fitted model and takes the output observed, then for each i in 1:n gives the best cutoff based on MCC. Valid only for binary classification. The cutoff is only below 0.5, otherwise one can just reverse.
